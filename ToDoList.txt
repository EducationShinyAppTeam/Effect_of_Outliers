# Ideas for Future Development

1. Make more detailed instructions.

2. If possible:
Maybe slow or delay the automatic slider in response to feedback: "The outlier, 
it moves too fast to show any changes, it needs more delay so the summary 
statistics and graphs can update and show the user the changes."

3. Add little paragraph below the heading of the Explore page and maybe a well 
panel in response to feedback: "I think it would be beneficial to add some sort 
of text description to the explore page because there are a lot of visuals and 
things to adjust (potentially a wellPanel to the sliders to help visually)."

4. Add to the overview page in reponse to feedback: "The overview page could use 
more information/instructions about the app." -sv101 ✓
